## 1. Project Overview <a class="anchor" id="project-description"></a>

In the era of digital streaming, the sheer volume of available anime content can be overwhelming for viewers seeking new series to watch. An anime recommendation system is designed to address this challenge by leveraging data science and machine learning techniques to provide personalized anime suggestions tailored to individual preferences. This project aims to develop an advanced recommendation system that enhances user experience by accurately predicting and suggesting anime series that users are likely to enjoy.

Objectives:
Data Collection and Preprocessing:

Gather a comprehensive dataset of anime series, including features such as genres, ratings, user reviews, and watch history.
Preprocess the data to handle missing values, normalize ratings, and prepare it for model training.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Perform EDA to uncover patterns, trends, and insights within the dataset.
Visualize the distribution of genres, popular anime series, and user rating behaviors.

Model Development:

Implement various recommendation algorithms, including collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid models.
Use matrix factorization techniques like Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to improve the accuracy of collaborative filtering models.

Evaluation and Optimization:

Evaluate the performance of the recommendation models using metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
Optimize the models through hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation to enhance recommendation quality.

Deployment:

Develop a user-friendly web application using Streamlit to allow users to interact with
